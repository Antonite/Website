This is the source code of my personal website.

## How to run

Run `npm install` to install required packages.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If `ng serve` failed to build for some reason, try `ng build` first.
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
